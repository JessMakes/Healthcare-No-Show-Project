# üìä Healthcare No-Show Analysis ‚Äì SQL Cleaning Script

This project focuses on preparing and transforming raw patient appointment data for effective analysis. The dataset contains patient demographics, appointment dates, and whether the patient showed up. Cleaning was done using **SQL**, and the result is a new table: `noshow_cleaned`.

##  Cleaning Objectives Using SQL

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
|  Rename Columns | Standardized column names for clarity |
|  Format Dates | Converted date columns to `YYYY-MM-DD` using `strftime()` |
|  Age Banding | Created age groups: `0‚Äì18`, `19‚Äì30`, `31‚Äì45`, `46‚Äì60`, `61+` |
|  Boolean Conversion | Changed `TRUE`/`FALSE` into human-readable `Yes`/`No` |
|  SMS Status | Renamed and recoded `SMS_received` to `Got SMS` / `No SMS` |
|  Show Status | Inverted `No-show` to a clearer `Showed Up` / `No-Show` label |
| ‚è± Wait Time | Added `Wait_Days` column by subtracting `ScheduledDay` from `AppointmentDay` |
