###  Data Cleaning and Transformation (SQL + Power Query)

The no-show patient dataset was cleaned and transformed using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power Query**. These tools were applied on separate occasions to demonstrate flexibility 
in using both code-first and visual transformation methods.

####  SQL-Based Cleaning

The following transformations were implemented using **SQLite** to create the cleaned table: `noshow_cleaned`.

| Task                   | Columns Affected                        | Description                                                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Format Dates           | ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay            | Converted to `YYYY-MM-DD` using `strftime()`                                |
| Create Age Groups      | Age â†’ Age_Band                          | Grouped into: `0â€“18`, `19â€“30`, `31â€“45`, `46â€“60`, `61+`                       |
| Convert Booleans       | Scholarship, Hypertension, etc.         | Converted `TRUE` â†’ `"Yes"`, `FALSE` â†’ `"No"`                                 |
| Relabel SMS Received   | SMS_received â†’ SMS_Status               | `"TRUE"` â†’ `"Got SMS"`, `"FALSE"` â†’ `"No SMS"`                              |
| Relabel Showed_Up      | No-show â†’ Show_Status                   | `"No"` â†’ `"Showed Up"`, `"Yes"` â†’ `"No-Show"`                               |
| Add Wait Time          | ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay â†’ Wait_Days| Calculated wait time using `julianday()` difference                         |

####  Power Query Cleaning (Power BI)

In a separate transformation exercise, **Excel** and **Power Query** were used to reshape the data for condition-level analysis and visualization.

| Task                      | Tool Used   | Columns Affected                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label SMS Status          | Excel       | SMS_received â†’ SMS_Status           | Converted binary: TRUE â†’ `"Got SMS"`, FALSE â†’ `"No SMS"`                   |
| Simplify No-show Logic    | Excel       | No-show â†’ Showed_Up                 | `"No"` â†’ `"Showed Up"`, `"Yes"` â†’ `"No-Show"`                              |
| Create Age Groups         | Excel       | Age â†’ Age Band                      | Banded into: `0â€“18`, `19â€“30`, `31â€“45`, `46â€“60`, `61+`                       |
| Unpivot Conditions        | Power Query | Diabetes, Hypertension, Alcoholism  | Unpivoted into a single `Condition` column                                 |
| Add Presence Indicator    | Power Query | Condition â†’ Present                 | Boolean column to indicate presence of condition                           |
| Filter Relevant Records   | Power Query | Present                             | Filtered for `Present = TRUE` only                                         |
| Relabel Attendance Status | Power Query | Showed_Up                           | Converted TRUE â†’ `"Showed Up"`, FALSE â†’ `"No-Show"`                        |

###  Why This Matters

Using **SQL** enabled backend data preparation with precision and performance â€” ideal for scalable analysis and BI reporting. Meanwhile,

**Power Query** and **Excel** allowed for rapid reshaping and intuitive, no-code data exploration.
